    <meta name="description" content="Improving software and software delivery capacity  What are we doing? Examining at the improvement of software delivery capacity Focussing on Just one technical area Removal of technical debt There are many other technical concerns, see later Individual, group, social and business areas, at several levels of concern Individual Team Organisational  Debt and technical debt  Debt Uh oh, you have a loan from a bank Is that ‘free’ money that you have to pay back? Do you only have to pay back the loan amount? Do you have to pay back the loan amount plus a fixed value for interest? Do you have to pay back the loan amount plus a recurrent value for interest? What happens if you keep on getting loans? Servicing the loans The scenario It’s three in the morning and you’ve just been woken up with a serious bug report that you have to fix for the company’s major client on the other side of the world.  You need to get a fix working quickly, and you take a short cut in your code, say you end up using a class for two distinct purposes What’s the scenario’s debt and the interest payments? Using one class for two purposes the the debt You pay it off by splitting the classes Until you pay off the debt, there is interest greater difficulty in dealing with your codebase Understanding the class Difficulties in use, special cases for each kind of use of the class Origins: Ward Cunningham Technical debt is  “the obligation incurred by a software organization when it chooses an expedient design or construction approach  that increases complexity  and is more costly in the long term”    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE  Types of technical debt It  depends see, eg, counter- example  Where you will see technical debt Code debt: Inconsistent coding style, nor following conventionsDesign debt: Choosing inappropriate designs, over-complex implementations,  designs which are not clear and understandable Architectural debt: Architectures which do not exhibit the required capabilities, which are not robust, which are inappropriately flexibleTest debt: Lack of tests, poor test coverage, and bad test design Documentation debt: None, wrong, unhelpful, INCORRECT Documentation debt:   Technical debt is invisible Technical debt impacts internal quality Technical debt is not generally seen by the end users of the software Defects are directly experienced by end users Defects get the attention, and there is pressure on developers to fix them Technical debt can easily be ignored, especially by business stakeholders Impossible to avoid Technical debt is impossible to avoid Abstract claim: Even the best code/system can be improved Practice: The rigors of working in a software development environment mean shortcuts and tradeoffs will be taken In general: General invisibility of technical debt to users means that there will always be always business pressures on developers for features, the things of value to users Dealing with short-term debt  Short-term debt Unintentional debt (bad development)  Identifiable significant short-cuts Identifiable tiny shortcuts   No problem if regularly paid off Plan for it and do it Do it as part of other development Review what is done and  what still needs to be done Dealing with architectural debt “Do nothing. When using this approach, it's important to understand the implications (both technical and economic) of &quot;doing nothing.&quot;“Replace the whole system. In some cases, this approach might have high cost and risk associated with it; in others, it might be precisely what is needed.“Incremental refactoring (commitment to invest). An explicit focus on architectural agility becomes an instrument in this approach.”https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2012/07/strategic-management-of-architectural-technical-debt.html   Read these  Portwood, M, Understanding Technical Debt  http://www.michaelportwood.com/Quick-Tips/Understanding-Technical-Debt.htm The first page of   Ford, N, Evolutionary architecture and emergent design: Investigating architecture and design  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-eaed1/   Optional, relax while you are cooking  Feathers, M.

On one level and from one (growing) perspective many would dispute this Agile methods are the largest opportunity for improving software development productivity  But this alternate view is still about  people and social organisation Individual competency Competency is “the ability to do something successfully or efficiently” Individual competency is the result of Innate individual propensity  Learned behavior Competence at the individual level is required for the creation of core business competence   Bassellier, G., Reich, B.H. &amp; Benbasat, I., 2001.

The literature “Failure rates in software projects are high, and qualified software engineers pertaining to software development teams are key factors in the software development process and their shortcomings and caveats” (Pressman, 2005) Pressman, RS, Software Engineering: a practitioner's approach, 7th Ed, McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2010 Functional and dysfunctional teams Teams can work superbly together Worked in and managed many such teams Teams can be characterized on a  Functional &lt;--------&gt; dysfunctional continuum Informal! On two axes Technical factors - technology and skills Eg we don’t have all the skills we need Social factors - how the team interacts and communicates Eg a destructive team member  Team member contributions  Augustine: More than 50% of the work is  typically done by 20% of the people  Augustine, NR, Augustine’s Laws and Major System Development Programs, Defense Systems Management Review, 1979, pp 50-16.  Reported in Demarco, T and Lister, T, Programmer Performance and Effects of the Workplace, http://teaching.davearnold.ca/3104/stuff/3104-W07-R6.pdf Old but seemingly still true...or not? What was measured? The right things? Start thinking about personalities, team roles, utilising skills Xerox Smalltalk Group example Lab evaluation for teamwork In part on being a productive mixed-ability team Good folklore abounds, eg project behind schedule? In general, increasing team size won’t solve the problem [Brooks, F, Mythical Man Month] What factors will improve the situation? Increasing intellectual clarity on the wicked problem will gain traction (all other things being equal) Maximise the potential for learning about the problem and its solution Building team capacity Individual learning in the context of building team capacity, eg through pair programming Contradiction: Bring in people with targeted skills rules are made to be broken in motivated ways Self-improving teams Seek, in the lab, to develop you as  members of self-improving teams  Develop individual and team self-awareness in the areas of Performance (measured and retrospectively observed) Technology and process use Communication (internal and external) Perform experiments to improve standard working practice If it succeeds, adopt the new practice Problems and improvements: Individual, team, organisation and business  Problems and improvements:  Organisational Introduction Does the development capacity of an organisation allow the the organisation to fulfill its purpose? The software development capacity of  an organisation should support  the organisation in enacting its mission Mission is a high level statement of what the organisation strives to do Eg: “Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.” And emphasizing change One thing is certain: Change is constant Can the organisation fulfill its purpose in the context of change?  Much depends on the organisation’s ability to respond to change, including Adverse change Change that opens up possibilities  BAA http://intellyx.com/introducing-the-bloomberg-agile-architecture-technique/the-core-concepts-of-bloomberg-agile-architecture/    Many ways to fail We’ll look at just two examples of failure at an organisational level Requirements failure Architectural failure  Note that the examples may depict failure at more than one level, I emphasize the organisational here Requirements failure Fleet-hire example (NDA in force) requirements do not not reflect the company’s real requirements Root causes: Lack of understanding of ‘real’ requirements, poor ability to gather requirements, lack of communication Solution: Change management programme aimed at rectifying the requirements gathering, and incorporating that into standard working practice Architectural failure MOO example: architecture is not extensible to new kinds of business activities Root cause: Architecture suited only to initial purposes as befits a start-up Solution: Hire a specific set of capabilities via the appointment of a “Head of Platform Architecture” Tasked to rectify the situation  Conway’s law As we will see, software architecture is an expression of both our experience and knowledge as software architects, and the match of that experience to problem domain But software architectures are also a product of organisational structure: Conway’s Law states: “. . . organizations which design systems . . . are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these orga- nizations.” A further way to fail, eg what might the effects of a traditional DBA-heavy organisation... Responses to organisational-level problems Naturally, in the search for profit, there have been several kinds of responses to organisational level problems with software delivery We discuss two of these The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Bloomberg Agile Architecture  Stressing technical competence The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) seeks improve software engineering capability within (or across) an organisation Defines five maturity levels for software engineering performance CMM is very much from the tradition of scientific management  a scientific management style Construction: Analyze, define Use: measure, act CMM levels (Wikipedia, CMM) Optimizing - process management includes deliberate process optimization/improvement.Managed - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with agreed-upon metrics.Defined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business processes.Repeatable - the process is at least documented sufficiently such that repeating the same steps may be attempted.Initial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point for use of a new or undocumented repeat process. Stressing a match betweenbusiness and technical capacity Total buzzfest - any value to BAA? Business agility (deals with change) based on  Resilience Ability to innovate System architecture and enterprise architecture The technical stuff Fit for purpose in the light of business agility The enterprise architecture is very service oriented Automation Not only reduction of overheads But also things which are not easily possible with humans Agile as a cure for organisational problems	 Taster “Perhaps Agile’s biggest contribution is the recognition of the humanness of systems development. Agile organizations connect software and the business, and Agile processes provide communication patterns connecting the system-building teams, and the teams with the business ... Like the forest architecture of the redwoods, Agile organizations evolve ecosystems in which experience and ideas live and grow....”  Everett, E, Foreword in Sterling, C, Managing software debt : building for inevitable change, Pearson, 2011  Conclusion and a note on expectations  If we have time Class review Rapidly, what stood out for you? Where did we touch on tradeoffs? The same topics re-occur in different contexts in this course unit How complex is software engineering?  What factors bear on it? What levels of investigation are involved? What we expect of you in this unit We expect more from you than SWEBOK Characteristics of all seven Bloom levels But not to expert level performance :) Shu with Ha characteristics In the labs Self-awareness (and team self-awareness) Reflection on how you can improve Improvement in some respect But we know becoming an expert takes years of practice"/>
